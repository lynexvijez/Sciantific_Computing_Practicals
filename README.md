## Project Overview

This collection of labs demonstrates **my journey and practical application of scientific computing principles** through data analysis. Each exercise systematically addresses a component of the data analysis pipeline—from transforming raw data into a usable format, to extracting meaningful insights, and finally, presenting these findings visually. The bike sales dataset provides a consistent and relatable context for understanding and practicing these computational skills.

## Lab Descriptions

Here's a detailed overview of each lab included in this repository:

### Lab 3.4.6: Preparing Data

* **Description:** This lab focuses on the critical initial stages of **data preparation**, a fundamental step in any scientific computing project. It involves practical exercises in understanding raw datasets, identifying and resolving common data quality issues, and structuring data for subsequent analysis. Topics include handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring overall data consistency, all essential for robust computational analysis.
* **Associated Files:**
    * `3.4.6_Lab_Preparing_Data.html`: My lab instructions and exercises for data preparation.
    * `Bike_Sales_Prepare_Lab_3.4.7.xlsx - Bike Sales.csv`: The primary dataset used for my data preparation exercises.

### Lab 4.2.7: Manipulating Data

* **Description:** This lab covers various **data manipulation techniques** necessary for transforming prepared data into a format suitable for in-depth analysis and visualization within a scientific computing context. My exercises involve filtering, sorting, merging datasets, creating new calculated columns, and aggregating data to derive specific insights, showcasing practical data handling and transformation skills.
* **Associated Files:**
    * `4.2.7_Lab_Manipulate_Data.html`: My lab instructions and exercises for data manipulation.
    * `Bike_Sales_Manipulate_Lab_4.2.7.csv`: The dataset used for my data manipulation exercises.

### Lab 5.3.3: Creating Visualizations in Excel

* **Description:** In this lab, I practiced creating diverse **data visualizations using Microsoft Excel**. This involved learning to select appropriate chart types (e.g., column, line, pie charts) to effectively represent data, formatting charts for maximum clarity and impact, and translating numerical data into compelling visual narratives—a crucial skill for communicating scientific computing results.
* **Associated Files:**
    * `5.3.3_Lab _Create_Visualizations_in_Excel.html`: My lab instructions and exercises for creating visualizations.
    * `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab.xlsx - Sales Data.csv`: General sales data I used for visualizations.
    * `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab.xlsx - Revenue and Profit by Year.csv`: Data I used specifically for time-series visualizations.
    * `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab.xlsx - Product Revenue by Country.csv`: Data I used for geographical or categorical visualizations.
    * `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab.xlsx - Revenue by Age Group.csv`: Data I used for demographic-based visualizations.
    * `Creating Visualizations- Column chart.png`: An example image of a column chart I created.
    * `Creating Visualizations- Line chart.png`: An example image of a line chart I created.

### Lab 5.4.5: Interpreting Visualizations with Respect to Outliers

* **Description:** This lab focused on enhancing my ability to **interpret data visualizations**, with a particular emphasis on identifying and understanding **outliers**. I explored how anomalous data points can influence analysis and visualization outcomes, and practiced techniques for recognizing them across various chart types—a vital skill for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of scientific computing analyses.
* **Associated Files:**
    * `5.4.5_Lab_Interpret_Visualizations_with_Respect_to_Outliers.html`: My lab instructions and exercises for outlier interpretation.
    * `Bike_Sales_Outlier_Lab.xlsx - Sheet1.csv`: A dataset likely containing outliers that I analyzed.
    * `Bike_Sales_Outlier_Lab.xlsx - Bike Sales.csv`: Another bike sales dataset I used in conjunction with outlier detection exercises.
